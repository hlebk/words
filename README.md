# Words
## About
This is my first project, which is written in vanilla js, html and css. I have developed this app in order to learn and experiment with basic web technologies.

It's still incomplete in many aspects (and the code is most likely garbage) but it just works and it's a decent tool for learning new vocabulary, so I've decided to share it with my friends and everyone who would like to use it.

## How does it work?
This app has no backend whatsoever, so you might as well clone the repo and use it offline. Refer to the "How to use" page for usage instructions.

## Future of this project
I don't think it will be maintained. It's more likely that I will rewrite it in the future, when I improve my skills and learn a JS framework.
Anyway, feel free to share your thoughts, criticism and suggestions with me.

## Why is it called "Words"?
I dont know.
